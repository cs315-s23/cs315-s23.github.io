## Requirements

1. You will develop RISC-V assembly language implementations of the following problems, and print the results to ensure that both the C implementation and your RISC-V implementation compute the correct answer.
1. Your executables must be named as follows, and must be compiled with a `Makefile`
1. We will test your projects using autograder

**to_upper**

Given a string of upper, lower, and non-alphanumeric characters, transform lowercase letters into uppercase letters.

    $./to_upper FooBar1
    C: FOOBAR1
    Asm: FOOBAR1

**max3**

Given three signed integer parameters, find the largest by comparing the first two, and then comparing the larger of those with the third. That is, max3_s must be implemented using two calls to `max2_s`.

    $ ./max3 2 4 6
    C: 6Asm: 6

**find_max_index**

Given an array of integers, return the index of the largest integer in the array

    $ ./find_max_index 5 4 3 2 1
    C: 0
    Asm: 0
    $./find_max_index 1 2 3 4 5
    C: 4
    Asm: 4

**sort**

Given the address of an array of unsigned integers, and the length of the array, sort the input array descending (largest to smallest) in place given the C implementation of the sorting algorithm. Your `sort_s` implementation must use `find_max_index_s`

    $ ./sort 10 30 20
    C: 30 20 10
    Asm: 30 20 10

## Given

1. The starter repo contains C implementations for each of the programs
1. Test cases are available in [https://github.com/cs315-s23/tests](https://github.com/cs315-s23/tests)

## Rubric

1. 80 points: automated test cases
1. 5 points: clean repo (no build products) which compiles and links successfully
1. 15 points: code quality: consistent formatting, no dead or redundant code, no unnecessarily complex code, readable comments
1. Fixes may be submitted up to one week after grades are posted
    1. Deductions for code quality and clean repo may be fixed for 100% credit
    1. Deductions for correctness or incomplete work may be fixed for 50% credit within 1 week of posted canvas scores
